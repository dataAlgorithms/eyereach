1. jupyter
a. change local directory
The followings steps work perfectly for me on Windows:

First find which directory Jupyter is looking in for your config file:

jupyter --config-dir
If there is no jupyter_notebook_config.py file in that directory, generate one by typing:

jupyter notebook --generate-config
Then edit the jupyter_notebook_config.py file and add something like:

## The directory to use for notebooks and kernels.
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = 'c:\\users\\rsignell\\documents\\github'
Then start your jupyter notebook from any directory:

jupyter notebook
and it will start in the directory you specified.
