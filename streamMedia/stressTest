  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY          The delay is the ramdom sleep when success in seconds.

                                   duration is the running time in seconds, tduration is the avarage duation of tasks.
                                   nread/nwrite in Mbps, duration/tduration in seconds.
                                   defaut: 30.00. 0 means no delay.

Examples:
1. start a client
   ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish -i doc/source.200kbps.768x320.flv -c 1 -r rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream
2. start 1000 clients
   ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish -i doc/source.200kbps.768x320.flv -c 1000 -r rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream_{i}
3. start 10000 clients
   ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish -i doc/source.200kbps.768x320.flv -c 10000 -r rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream_{i}
4. start 100000 clients
   ./objs/sb_rtmp_publish -i doc/source.200kbps.768x320.flv -c 100000 -r rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/live/livestream_{i}
